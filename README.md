- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @ryledet, an aerospace engineering student at Iowa State University. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about Github, Python, and LaTeX, as well as improving my coding skills and applying them to engineering.
- Iâ€™m currently working on surviving my first class in controls :). My hobbies include most things outdoors: skiing, backpacking, fishing, and more!!
